# Enhance-Simulator
It do things. 

Create a virtual environment, run the only file there right now :).

All of the variables in enhancing are user input based right now.  (the exception is every final stage hit is potent only because I didn't think anyone would want to sim without it. Could add it back in later.)

Everything that to my knowledge works is uncommented. Anything commented is either in development, comments, or debugging.

I will at one point make the code more readable with doc strings and actual class work and what not, just not until I get the cost analyzer in. Cost analyzer is the trigger for a v0.1 first "release" if you will.
